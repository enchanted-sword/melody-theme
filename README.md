melody is a sleek, simple theme for tumblr that is easily editable to suit your needs. It uses a series of simple flex containers that even a novice in web design can easily work with, and all the code is contained within one `html` file.

## Features
- Tag, search, and day pages
- Light and Dark modes
- Blog view link button for ease of editing your posts
- Following list
- Header size adaptability
- Reblog header with blog preview

## Installation
Simply copy the contents of `main.html` into the custom theme html section on the blog customization page

## Basic customization
Without touching the code, you can still customize your page to a degree by changing the background color, title color, accent color, viewed link color, and page header text color as well as adding a header image.

### Background Color
Used for:
- The main container background
- The ask background

### Title Color
Used for:
- Borders around the navigation cards
- All non-post or link text in the theme

### Accent Color
Used for:
- Links
- User URLS
- Blog view link button
- The reblog icon in the reblog header
- The note count in the post footer

### Viewed Link Color
This goes hand-in hand with the accent color, so choose a similar color but darker and/or desaturated

### Page Header Text Color
The color for the page header text, such as on search and tag pages.

### Header Image
The header image that displays at the top of the page will display your header image at its original aspect ratio, scaled down to 360px in height by default. By selecting "Stretch to fit" in the theme options, you can override this and stretch the image to the full page width.
